## About the Project

This repository contains a set of simple PowerShell scripts aimed at helping administrators streamline routine tasks in Windows environments. 
With a focus on ease-of-use and flexibility, they can be applied in various IT workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these scripts, you will need:

- Windows PowerShell (version 5.1 or higher) or PowerShell Core.
- Administrative privileges, as some scripts require elevated permissions.
- (Optional) Modules like `ActiveDirectory` for specific tasks, which can be installed via:

  ```powershell
  Install-Module -Name ActiveDirectory
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gianni-smdt/powershell-scripts.git
    ```
    ```bash
    cd powershell-scripts
    ```
    
2. Ensure that execution policies are set to allow the running of scripts:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    ```
## Usage

Each script comes with documentation and examples within the file itself. Below is a general overview:

- **Running a script**: Navigate to the script's directory and execute:

    ```powershell
    .\ScriptName.ps1 
    ```

- **Running a script with parameters**: Some scripts could include parameters for flexibility. For instance:

    ```powershell
    .\ScriptName.ps1 -Parameter1 Value1 -Parameter2 Value2
    ```

- **Scheduled tasks**: To automate, use Task Scheduler or cron jobs (for PowerShell Core on Linux) to run these scripts periodically.
